## Version 2.1 - October 2, 2025

### üéâ Major New Feature: Clipboard Queue Mode

**What's New:**
- Clipboard monitoring now has **two modes**: Speak or Queue
- **Speak Mode**: Immediately speaks copied text (original behavior)
- **Queue Mode**: Automatically adds copied text to speech queue ‚≠ê NEW!

**How to Use:**
1. Enable "üìé Monitor Clipboard" checkbox
2. Choose your mode:
   - **Speak**: For immediate playback
   - **Queue**: For collecting items to play later
3. Copy text from anywhere
4. In Queue mode, click "‚ñ∂ Play Queue" when ready to listen

**Perfect For:**
- üìö Research: Copy excerpts from multiple web pages, listen to all later
- üì∞ News Reading: Queue up articles while browsing, batch listen
- üìñ Study Materials: Collect lecture notes and review in sequence
- üåê Multi-source Content: Gather text from different sources for continuous playback

**Visual Indicators:**
- Queue items from clipboard show "üìã Clipboard:" prefix
- Easy to distinguish from files (üìÑ) and manual text entries

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Python 3.13 Threading

**Problem Solved:**
- Fixed GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) error that was crashing the app in Python 3.13
- Error: "PyEval_RestoreThread: the function must be called with the GIL held..."

**Solution:**
- Added proper COM (Component Object Model) initialization for Windows threads
- `pythoncom.CoInitialize()` at thread start
- `pythoncom.CoUninitialize()` at thread end
- Applied to both regular speech and queue playback

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ App now runs perfectly on Python 3.13
